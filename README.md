[![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/d/desktop-everywhere.svg)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/desktop-everywhere/statistics/)

A WebExtension which redirects mobile links to desktop equivalents.  For
example, https://mobile.nytimes.com/ will redirect to https://nytimes.com/ .
Desktop Everywhere uses a whitelist; please open GitHub issues or pull requests
for additional redirects.
